For the last few years, I have been working at Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC), a non-profit and WHO collaborating centre. At UMC we are concerned with adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which are unintended, harmful reactions to medication. We constantly monitor our database of reports of adverse drug reactions to find new, rare and/or harmful adverse drug reactions to drugs currently in routine use. We call a new suspected ADR a _signal_, and the practise of finding them _signal detection_.

Disproportionality analysis (DA) is a stalwart of signal detection in pharmacovigilance. DA is about comparing the number of times we observe

Standard dictionataries for medical terms or drugs often run in the 10s of thousands of terms.
