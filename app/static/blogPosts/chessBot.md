There's a YouTuber who I've been following some time called [SebastianLague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague). He makes really great content aroud coding, particularly of games. I came to his channel via a video he made on writing a chess engine, and he recently [announced a competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58). The challenge is the write a chess engine, but with a restricted amount of real estate with which to write the code. I thought this sounded like it could be fun, so I downloaded and setup the competition repo.

He encourages both serious and silly submissions, so I thought I'd go for somewhere in between. The name of my bot is going to be Mrs Norbury, because it's a pusher. It pushes pawns.
