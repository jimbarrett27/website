"""Routes triage decisions into external tools (Zotero + Obsidian).

Side effects mutate the paper row in place (``zotero_key``/``zotero_error`` and
``obsidian_path``/``obsidian_error``); the caller persists them. Failures are
recorded on the row rather than raised, so a decision always succeeds even if
routing doesn't — matching the spec's best-effort tolerance.
