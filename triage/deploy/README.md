# Triage backend — deployment & Cloudflare Access runbook (build step 3)

Goal: expose the triage backend at `https://triage-api.<domain>` through a
Cloudflare Tunnel, gated by Cloudflare Access so only your Google identity can
reach it, and verify end-to-end from the work laptop.

The backend code already enforces the Access identity header as defence in
depth (see `TRIAGE_REQUIRE_CF_ACCESS` in `triage/config.py`). The steps below
are the operational glue — most must be run by you (interactive login + the
Cloudflare dashboard).

---

## 0. Prerequisite — a domain on Cloudflare  ⚠️ blocking

A named tunnel's hostname can only be created in a DNS zone Cloudflare manages,
and Access requires Zero Trust. Pick one:

- **Move an existing domain:** Cloudflare dashboard → *Add a site* → enter your
  domain → choose the Free plan → Cloudflare gives you two nameservers → set
  those at your current registrar. Propagation is usually minutes–hours.
- **Register a new domain:** Cloudflare dashboard → *Registrar* → register one
  (it lands on Cloudflare DNS automatically).

Then enable **Zero Trust** (dashboard → Zero Trust → pick a team name → Free
plan). This is what provides Access.

> Until a domain is on Cloudflare, the rest of this runbook can't run. The
> backend, frontend, and config below are all ready and waiting for it.

---

## 1. Install cloudflared on jim-server (systemd)

```bash
# Cloudflare apt repo (Debian/Ubuntu):
sudo mkdir -p --mode=0755 /usr/share/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-main.gpg \
  | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-main.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-main.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflared any main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflared.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y cloudflared
cloudflared --version
```

## 2. Authenticate & create the tunnel  (interactive — run via `! …`)

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login            # opens a browser; pick your domain/zone
cloudflared tunnel create triage    # prints a TUNNEL_UUID + writes creds json
```

The credentials JSON lands in `~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_UUID>.json`.

## 3. Tunnel config

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloudflared
sudo cp triage/deploy/cloudflared-config.yml.example /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
# Move the tunnel creds where root's service can read them, then edit config:
sudo cp ~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_UUID>.json /root/.cloudflared/   # mkdir if needed
sudoedit /etc/cloudflared/config.yml   # fill in <TUNNEL_UUID> (domain already set)
```

## 4. Create the DNS record for the hostname

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns triage triage-api.jimbarrett.dev
```

## 5. Run cloudflared as a service

```bash
sudo cloudflared service install      # generates the systemd unit from config.yml
sudo systemctl enable --now cloudflared
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
```

## 6. Cloudflare Access application (Zero Trust dashboard)

Zero Trust → **Access → Applications → Add an application → Self-hosted**:

- **Application domain:** `triage-api.jimbarrett.dev` (whole host).
- **Policy:** Action *Allow*; Include → *Emails* → `jimbarrett27@gmail.com`.
- **CORS settings (important):** the SPA calls this host cross-origin, so the
  browser sends an unauthenticated `OPTIONS` preflight that Access would
  otherwise challenge. In the application's CORS settings:
  - Access-Control-Allow-Origins: `https://jimbarrett.dev`
  - Allow credentials: on
  - Methods: GET, POST · Headers: `*`
- Leave `/healthz` reachable — it's open in the app and used for probes.

> The `/triage` SPA route itself is **not** gated here (jimbarrett.dev is on App
> Engine, not Cloudflare). That's fine per the design: the route fetches
> nothing until a request clears Access on this API. If you later move the site
> behind Cloudflare, add a second Access app for `jimbarrett.dev/triage`.

## 7. Backend production env + service

```bash
sudo cp triage/deploy/triage.env.example /etc/triage.env
sudoedit /etc/triage.env             # set TRIAGE_ZOTERO_ENABLED=true (origins prefilled)
sudo cp triage/deploy/triage-backend.service.example \
        /etc/systemd/system/triage-backend.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now triage-backend
curl -s localhost:8077/healthz       # {"status":"ok"}
```

## 8. Verify end-to-end (from the work laptop)

- `https://triage-api.jimbarrett.dev/healthz` → `{"status":"ok"}` (open).
- `https://triage-api.jimbarrett.dev/api/triage/queue` in a browser → redirected
  to the Access login; after signing in as the allowed email → JSON.
- Point the Angular app's API base at `https://triage-api.jimbarrett.dev`
  (replacing the dev proxy) and load `/triage` — it should list papers once
  you're past Access. (Frontend base-URL switch is a small follow-up.)

### Quick negative checks
- Signing in with a different Google account → blocked by the Access policy.
- A direct request without the Access header (only possible if the backend were
  reachable off-tunnel) → 403 from the backend's own guard.

## Zotero credentials (build step 7)

`deep` decisions push the paper into your personal Zotero library. Both
credentials live in GCP Secret Manager (matching the Telegram bot's secrets), so
the backend fetches them at push time and nothing sensitive sits in the env file:

1. **API key** — create at <https://www.zotero.org/settings/security> →
   *Applications* (needs read/write to your personal library):
   ```bash
   printf %s 'PASTE_KEY' | gcloud secrets create ZOTERO_API_KEY \
     --project=personal-website-318015 --data-file=-
   # later rotations: gcloud secrets versions add ZOTERO_API_KEY --data-file=-
   ```
2. **User ID** — the numeric *userID* shown on that same settings page:
   ```bash
   printf %s 'NUMERIC_USER_ID' | gcloud secrets create ZOTERO_USER_ID \
     --project=personal-website-318015 --data-file=-
   ```

Enable pushing with `TRIAGE_ZOTERO_ENABLED=true` in `/etc/triage.env` (empty/false
disables it — dev default). A push failure is recorded on the row (`zotero_error`)
and never blocks the decision; the step-8 retry loop re-attempts. Idempotent via
the stored `zotero_key`.
