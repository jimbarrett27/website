  "content": "<p>This morning I participated in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group Science Jamboree 2016, where I managed to win a prize (chocolates!) for the best talk. I&#39;m not quite sure how I managed it, since in the midst of a series of informative and engaging talks, I performed a silly little poem;</p>\n<p><em>For my science Jamboree\nI&#39;ll tell you a bit about me\nMy journey through physics\nin a few clumsy limericks\nRight through to my PhD</em></p>\n<p><em>I was born in July &#39;91\nIn the blistering east Norfolk sun\nAnd... oh wait a minute,\nthere&#39;s a strict time limit\nSo I had best be getting along</em></p>\n<p><em>We&#39;ll skip ahead 18 odd years\nWhilst I, still wet &#39;round the ears\nkicked off my degree,\neager to see,\nHow I felt after 2 dozen beers</em></p>\n<p><em>But I did learn some physics as well\nEinsten, Newton, Maxwell\nBut as some of you know,\nnot a lot of astro\nAlthough I think you can probably all tell</em></p>\n<p><em>To be honest I found space a bit dreary\nI preferred condensed matter theory\nmy vague proclivity\nfor superconductivity\n&quot;I should do a PhD in this clearly!&quot;</em></p>\n<p><em>Alas, I left those low temperatures\nAnd became a software developer\nbut the real world is crap\nI resolved to come back\nAnd I somehow became an Astronomer....</em></p>\n<p><em>My first project involved an obsession\nwith continuous autoregression\ntake an impulse response\nto stochastic nonsense\net voila! banded matrix compression!</em></p>\n<p><em>And with that O(n) inference\nTime to write a paper of significance!\nExcept instabilities\ndestroy all utility\nTry selling that at a conference!</em></p>\n<p><em>So my PhD project, take 2!\nBut what was I going to do?\nI felt it was prudent\nto become Ilya&#39;s student\nsince bless him, he&#39;s only got a few</em></p>\n<p><em>Binary population synthesis;\ni.e how did it end up like this?\nwhich hyperparameters\nmake a chirp that glamorous?\nThe combinations seem virtually limitless</em></p>\n<p><em>So here&#39;s where I come in\nWhen parameter space coverage is thin\nwe can interpolate\nperhaps extrapolate\nwhat happens when things spiral in</em></p>\n<p><em>Now this work isn&#39;t finished yet\nIve tried random forests and neural nets\nbut despite all my labour\nit seems nearest neighbours\nmay well be our safest bet</em></p>\n<p><em>To conclude my science Jamboree\nI&#39;ll make a short summary\nmy project got switched\nbecause CARMA&#39;s a bitch\nand I write really shit poetry!</em></p>\n"
