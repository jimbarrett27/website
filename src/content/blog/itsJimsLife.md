This morning I participated in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group Science Jamboree 2016, where I managed to win a prize (chocolates!) for the best talk. I'm not quite sure how I managed it, since in the midst of a series of informative and engaging talks, I performed a silly little poem;

_For my science Jamboree
I'll tell you a bit about me
My journey through physics
in a few clumsy limericks
Right through to my PhD_

_I was born in July '91
In the blistering east Norfolk sun
And... oh wait a minute,
there's a strict time limit
So I had best be getting along_

_We'll skip ahead 18 odd years
Whilst I, still wet 'round the ears
kicked off my degree,
eager to see,
How I felt after 2 dozen beers_

_But I did learn some physics as well
Einsten, Newton, Maxwell
But as some of you know,
not a lot of astro
Although I think you can probably all tell_

_To be honest I found space a bit dreary
I preferred condensed matter theory
my vague proclivity
for superconductivity
"I should do a PhD in this clearly!"_

_Alas, I left those low temperatures
And became a software developer
but the real world is crap
I resolved to come back
And I somehow became an Astronomer...._

_My first project involved an obsession
with continuous autoregression
take an impulse response
to stochastic nonsense
et voila! banded matrix compression!_

_And with that O(n) inference
Time to write a paper of significance!
Except instabilities
destroy all utility
Try selling that at a conference!_

_So my PhD project, take 2!
But what was I going to do?
I felt it was prudent
to become Ilya's student
since bless him, he's only got a few_

_Binary population synthesis;
i.e how did it end up like this?
which hyperparameters
make a chirp that glamorous?
The combinations seem virtually limitless_

_So here's where I come in
When parameter space coverage is thin
we can interpolate
perhaps extrapolate
what happens when things spiral in_

_Now this work isn't finished yet
Ive tried random forests and neural nets
but despite all my labour
it seems nearest neighbours
may well be our safest bet_

_To conclude my science Jamboree
I'll make a short summary
my project got switched
because CARMA's a bitch
and I write really shit poetry!_
