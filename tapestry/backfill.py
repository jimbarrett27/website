"""One-off: regenerate stored tapestry panels' artwork with the current model/prompt.

Re-runs the generator over panels already in GCS, reusing each day's stored
stories so only the *artwork* changes (same news, new rendering). Panels are
regenerated oldest-first and each one is given the freshly regenerated previous
panel as its ``previous_svg``, so the seams actually join across the run.

``--since`` regenerates only the tail of the tapestry, which is the usual case:
the first regenerated day is seeded with the *stored* SVG of the last day being
kept, so the new run stitches onto the existing panels at that seam instead of
starting from a blank slate.

Overwrites the canonical panels in place, but first copies the artwork it's
replacing into ``alt/`` (see :mod:`tapestry.storage`), so a model experiment can
always be looked at again -- or reverted -- afterwards. Safe to re-run. Needs the
same GCP + LLM credentials as the daily job:

    uv run python -m tapestry.backfill --since 2026-07-14
